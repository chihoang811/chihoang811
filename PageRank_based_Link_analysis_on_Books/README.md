# PageRank-based Link Analysis on Books

- Based on the publicly available Amazon Book Review dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews), the objective is to develop a ranking system using PageRank-based Link Analysis to identify the most influential books. 
- This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks and one PDF report describing the project:
    - **Book_rating_no_Similarity_checked.ipynb**  
        Implements a PageRank-based link analysis on books without considering title similarity.

    - **Book_rating_Similarity_checked.ipynb**  
        Extends the previous approach by applying Jaccard similarity to detect and merge duplicated or highly similar book titles.

    - For proper visualization of hyperlinks and figure references, **please download the PDF file** and view it locally.
